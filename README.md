# Musical Wallpaper
Turn your favourite albums on Spotify into your new favourite desktop wallpaper

You just supply the URL of a playlist (make your own or use someone else's) containing your favourite album covers. Musical Wallpaper downloads the album covers using the Spotify API, then stitches them together into wallpapers. You can specify the size of the album artwork to fit more onscreen.

网易云音乐和QQ音乐API现在无法使用了，请转换到Spotify歌单再进行使用。转换歌单的方法可参考：https://github.com/bjason/163MusicToSpotify

# Mode Introduction
## Ranking Mode
This mode generates a countdown chart according to the playlist ID you provide. Noted that the order are reversed, which means the number 1 song will appear at the bottom of the picture.

## Zune Mode
If you are a Zune enthusiast you probably gonna miss the cover wall Zune once provides. This mode will make a wallpaper with the album covers from the playlist you provide in different sizes, which is just like the Zune Now Playing UI.
